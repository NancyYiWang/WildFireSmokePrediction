>>vwnd: Refers to the vertical (V) component of wind velocity, typically representing the north-south wind direction. <br>
>>uwnd: Refers to the horizontal (U) component of wind velocity, representing the east-west wind direction. <br>
>>rhum: Refers to relative humidity, expressed as a percentage (%). <br>
>>omega: Refers to vertical velocity in pressure coordinates, typically measured in Pascals per second (Pa/s). <br>
