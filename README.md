  uwnd: Refers to the horizontal (U) component of wind velocity, representing the east-west wind direction. 
  rhum: Refers to relative humidity, expressed as a percentage (%).
  omega: Refers to vertical velocity in pressure coordinates, typically measured in Pascals per second (Pa/s).
  hgt: Refers to geopotential height, which is the height of a pressure surface in the atmosphere, usually measured in meters.
  air: Refers to air temperature
